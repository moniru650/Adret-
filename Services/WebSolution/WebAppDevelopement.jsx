                  An API is a computing interface that underlines the
                  interactions between multiple software intermediaries. RESTful
                  API development is a core focus at Adret Software Services. We
                  craft secure custom REST framework as a robust and flexible
                  toolkit for creating custom web APIs. We maintain a
                  three-level protocol to ensure REST API security -
                  authentication / tokenization, encryption and origin
                  validation.

                  Our programmers are efficient in working with a variety of
                  database to ensure that your application’s data is completely
                  secure and easily accessible whenever needed. Our expertise
                  extends to various relational and non-relational database
                  management systems including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and NoSQL
                  database (MongoDB, Apache Cassandra). We specialize on using
                  Database Middleware that supports interoperability between
                  various software components, facilitates distributed
                  transaction execution, helps to improve database services like
                  fault tolerance and performance scaling, and also adapts to
                  workloads by using adaptive queuing middleware.

                  Version control system helps the development team to manage
                  any change to the source code over time. It keeps track of all
                  the modifications done to a code in a specific database. In
                  case of any unintended error, the developers can turn to the
                  previous version and fix the issues. Since an entire
                  development team works on a project, it’s better to organize
                  the codes for the apps in the file tree and keep a track of
                  the changes. This accelerates the process of a glitch-free app
                  development. We prefer Bitbucket and GitHub to support our
                  source control needs and maintain a smooth workflow.

                    <p>
                    Websites primarily provide static content and information, while web applications are dynamic, allowing users to interact, perform tasks, and receive personalized experiences. Web applications often involve complex functionality, data processing, and user input.

                    <p>
                    The development time for a web application varies based on factors such as project complexity, features, and client requirements. Simple web applications might take a few weeks, while more complex ones can take several months. A thorough project analysis can provide a more accurate estimate.

                    Web application development involves various technologies. Front-end development often utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular. For back-end development, languages like Node.js, Python (Django), Ruby (Ruby on Rails), and PHP are common. Databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB are also widely used.

                    Security is a top priority in web application development. Measures include data encryption, secure coding practices, input validation, and regular security audits. Implementing user authentication and authorization, using HTTPS, and staying updated on security best practices are crucial for safeguarding web applications
